Method (procedure) description for LOC-I Meshblock to Catchment linkset

ASGS Meshblocks are ingested directly from the ABS WFS at https://geo.abs.gov.au/arcgis/services/ASGS2016/MB/MapServer/WFSServer
Geofabric Contracted Catchments are ingested from the Geofabric v2.1 downloadable distribution from http://www.bom.gov.au/water/geofabric/download.shtml

Contracted Catchment polygons are interpreted as EPSG:4326
ASGS Mesblock polygons are converted from EPSG:3857 to ESPS:4326 for the creation of these intersections

Polygons with self-interesecting boundaries are corrected using the ST_Makevalid() postgis function.

Intersections are detected using the ST_Intersects() postgis function, and materialised using the ST_Intersection() postgis function.

Polygon areas, along with the intersectional polygon areas, are calculated using the ST_Area() postgis function with spheroid correction enabled.

Meshblock to Contracted Catchment intersectional proportions are calulated by dividing the intersectional area by the meshblock polygon area.
Contracted Catchment to Meshblock intersectional proportions are calulated by dividing the intersectional area by the catchment polygon area.

Invalid meshblocks are detected using the invalid meshblocks method described below, and removed from the following classifications.

Meshblocks are considered 'within' a Contracted Catchment if the intersectional proportion is greater than or equal to 99%.
Meshblocks are considered 'overlaps' but not 'within' a Contracted Catchment if the intersectional proportion is greater than or equal to 1%, and less than than 99%.
Meshblocks are considered neither 'overlaps' nor 'within' a Contracted Catchment if the intersectional proportion is less than 1%.

Contracted Catchments are considered 'within' a Meshblock if the intersectional proportion is greater than or equal to 99%.
Contracted Catchments are considered 'overlaps' but not 'within' a Meshblock if the intersectional proportion is greater than or equal to 1%, and less than than 99%.
Contracted Catchments are considered neither 'overlaps' nor 'within' a Meshblock if the intersectional proportion is less than 1%.

Method for identifying invalid Meshblocks

Meshblocks considered invalid for the purposes of the LOC-I linkset creation are those that have an total polygon area of less than 1100m2 AND
    EITHER
    * a meshblock to catchment overlap proportion of greater than 1% AND a meshblock to catchment overlap area of less than 50m2.
    OR
    * a catchment to meshblock overlap proportion of greater than 1% AND a catchment to meshblock overlap area of less than 50m2.

The meshblocks matching these conditions are found to be very small polygons with negligable catchment overlaps but trigger false-positive classifications for 'overlaps' and 'within'.
